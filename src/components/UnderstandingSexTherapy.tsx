          In a non-judgmental environment, clients can explore emotional and psychological factors contributing to sexual difficulties, such as anxiety, stress, past trauma, or relationship issues. Many individuals may hold misconceptions or lack adequate knowledge about sexual health, making education a vital part of the therapy process. Therapists provide clear information on sexual anatomy, bodily functions, and effective communication strategies.
